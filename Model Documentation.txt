The solution is mostly based on the one given in the walkthrough.
The only change is the line changing logic (Line 270-317).

In case the current lane is congested, the lanes next to the current
lane is checked to see if any of them are clear from vehicles.
This is done by implementing a counter that is incremented for each
vehicle closer than a certain threshold. Both the front and rear sides
are considered. However, a higher threshold is used for the rear side,
because the vehicle behind us is coming towards us, and we need to have
some larger clearence to avoid collision while changing lanes.
A lower threshold is fine for the car in front because it is moving away.

If a clear lane is found in either side of the current lane, the reference
velocity is set to just under the maximum (50.0 mph) before changing lanes.
If there is no lane that can be changed into, the velocity of the vehicle
immediately in front of the vehicle is set as the target velocity, and the
current lane is maintained.

Being in Lane 1 will give us a higher chance of finding a less congested lane if
we run into a congestion. So even if the current lane is not congested, but
the current lane is not Lane 1, we change to Lane 1 if Lane 1 is not congested.
This atcually improved the performance considerably and gives a lap time of under
5 mins and 20 secs unless the car gets caught in the middle of a particularly slow
traffic jam.
