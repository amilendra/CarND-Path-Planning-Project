The solution is mostly based on the one given in the walkthrough.
The only change is the line changing logic carried out when the
current lane becomes congested (Line 270-302).

The lanes next to the current lane is checked to see if any of them are
clear from vehicles. This is done by implementing a counter, that is
incremented for each vehicle closer than a certain threshold. Both
the front side and rear side are considered. However, a higher threshold 
is considered for the front side, because the intention is to accelerate
as long as possible, and there is no point of changing lanes, if we are 
going to run into another traffic block soon.

If a clear lane is found in either side of the current lane, the reference
velocity is set to just under the maximum (49.5). If there is no clear lane,
that can be changed into, the velocity of the vehicle immediately in front
of the vehicle is set as the target velocity, and the current lane is maintained.
